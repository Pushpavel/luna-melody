# Luna Melody

Luna Melody is a full-stack music web application for piano transcription and MIDI visualization. It features a modern React frontend and a FastAPI backend, both served together on `localhost:8000`. Users can upload MIDI files, or provide a YouTube video link. The backend will automatically transcribe audio into MIDI using state-of-the-art deep learning model, allowing users to interactively explore and visualize the results.

## Features

- üìÅ MIDI file upload
- üé• YouTube link to MIDI file
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è MIDI player
- üåü Reactive background (reacts to the music's intensity)

## Demo

## Prerequisites

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (must be in your PATH)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package manager)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

Open a terminal and run:

```sh
cd backend
uv sync
```

This will install all Python dependencies using `uv`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

From the project root, run:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```

This installs Node.js dependencies and builds the frontend.

### 3. Run the Server

Start the backend server (serves both frontend and API):

```sh
uv run fastapi run main.py
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Notes

- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible from your terminal.
- For development, you may want to use `npm run dev` for hot-reloading the frontend (served separately).
